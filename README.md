# About

AeriesKit does not use the offical Aeries API and is not related. It works without needing an api key from your respective school district because it scrapes information off of the Aeries web portal. These functions are more important if you wish to create your own version of the dashboard.

If you have any problems or questions regarding AeriesKit, please open an issue.

# How to Use
